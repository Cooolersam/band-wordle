## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 3. Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 🗄️ Supabase Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up/login and create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready

### 2. Create Database Table
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the scores table
CREATE TABLE scores (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
  section TEXT NOT NULL,
  guesses INTEGER NOT NULL,
  solved BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create unique constraint to prevent multiple submissions per user per day
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_user_date ON scores (nickname, date);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to allow all operations (for demo purposes)
-- In production, you might want to restrict this
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations" ON scores FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### 3. Get API Keys
1. Go to Project Settings → API
2. Copy the Project URL and anon public key
3. Add them to your `.env` file

3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Build command: `npm run build`
6. Publish directory: `dist`
7. Add environment variables in Site Settings → Environment Variables

### Option 2: Vercel

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Restart the dev server after adding variables
   - Check that variable names start with `VITE_`

2. **Supabase Connection Errors**
   - Verify your URL and API key are correct
   - Check that your Supabase project is active
   - Ensure the `scores` table exists

3. **Build Errors**
   - Clear `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
   - Check Node.js version: `node --version`

### Development Tips

- Use browser dev tools to check for console errors
- Check the Network tab for API call failures
- Verify Supabase policies allow the operations you need
